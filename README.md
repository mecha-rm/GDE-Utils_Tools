# GDE---Utils_Tools
A file for various utility functions and tools useful for common coding practices.
[EXPANDED COMMENTS TO COME SOON]

NOTE:
The utils project no longer works for some reason. I do not understand why (it might have to do with a Windows 10 update or something), but I can't work on it anymore.
I'm going to make changes and see if I can fix it. I created a branch titled "preservation_branch" to perserve the build as is, since it should still work for people.
I'm going to update this README in the event that my fixes work.

Features:
- Collision: collision functions for games.
- Color: coverts color from [0, 1] range to [0, 255] range and vice-versa.
- LargeInt: a storage class for numbers that can be larger than the C++ limit.
- Sorting: sorting algorithms for vectors and lists.
	- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort

TODO:
- complete sorting techniques and test all of them.
- finish periodic table.
- complete randomizer functions.

This project likely won't be updated anymore.
